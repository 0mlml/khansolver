## khansolver

prints out answers for khan academy problems. works by intercepting the request responses for khan academy api calls. 
i've manually added handling for lots of question types but there might be some that are unsupported.

this was not developed with ux in mind, just to cheat on khan academy assignemnts i had for a class.

the hotkey is alt + k
